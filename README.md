E-commerce_shopper-s-behavior-understanding_ml

Assume that you are working in a consultancy company and one of your client is running an e-commerce company. They are interested in understanding the customer behavior regarding the shopping. They have already collected the users’ session data for a year. Each row belongs to a different user. The “Made_purchase” is an indicator that whether the user has made a purchase or not during that year. Your client is also interested in predicting that column using other attributes of the users. The client also informs you that the data is collected by non-experts. So, it might have some percentage of error in some columns.

We have train data , which we will use for training our model. Then we have test data where we will use the trained model and get the output for those.
